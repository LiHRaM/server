# server-go

This package is a part of an [experiment](https://github.com/LiHRaM/riot-android) in embedding [Dendrite](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite) in [Riot for Android](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-android).

It is therefore first and foremost a library package.
If you want to run it as a binary, you can run it via `main/main.go`.
